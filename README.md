Business Objectives:
Nespresso wants to maintain its position as a leader in the premium
coffee market. It wants to prioritise product innovation, developing
new coffee blends and brewing systems. Customer satisfaction is also
important, with Nespresso being committed to improving the overall
customer experience based on customer feedback. As part of its
corporate social responsibility efforts, Nespresso wants customers to
have positive perceptions of the sustainability of its pods.

Research aims:
Nespresso wants to accurately understand customersâ€™ preferences for
new coffee blends (such as seasonal varieties) and new brewing
technologies. Due to competitive pressures in the sector, Nespresso
wants to better understand any customer pain points to identify areas
for improvement in product quality, packaging, and customer service.
Nespresso also wants to evaluate the effectiveness of its sustainability
initiatives and identify opportunities for further improvement.
